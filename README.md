# Stock-Analysis
## Overview of Project Explain the purpose of this analysis.
### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to compare different stocks or indexes daily opening and closing prices to see which stocks fared better or worse at the end of each year. The importance of this is to ensure that any stock that catches the eye has a record of being a firm standing stock that will create a positive return at the end of each year.

## VBA Analysis 
### Analysis DQ Analysis

Based on the dataset of 2018 DQ didn’t fare well at all compared to 2017. The total volume for DQ in 2017 was 35.8 million with a return of 199.4% while 2018’s total volume was tripled of 2017 with a 62.6%decrease in financial returns. Despite being a more popular index in 2018 it still didn’t do so well. Therefore, it was a great choice to choose the index to invest in as there’s possibility of returns being even lower. 

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring Code

The advantages of refactoring code are creating a more efficient code that doesn’t have any duplications, making sure comments are in the right spots. Also, during this time you can debug in parts of the program that you didn’t before even though it worked without debugging.  

The disadvantages of refactoring code are that it might not run any longer. Then in turn trying to fix the new code making it a time-consuming task. This could make us miss deadlines or close to missing them. 


### Advantages and Disadvantages of VBA Refactoring Code

Well in my case refactoring the code came with a lot of problems. Originally my code worked somewhat but with refactoring it didn’t work at all and I couldn’t figure out the problem.  The advantages would be that multiple loops would be replaced with one seamless nested loop.
